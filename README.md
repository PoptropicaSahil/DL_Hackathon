Analytics Competition hosted by the Analytics Club IITM in association with Techsoc IITM, as part of Pre Inter IIT Season

### Description

Categories are used to help customer navigate through our website and classify products to product type groups. Hence, it is important to predict the node assignment at the time of listing of the product or when the browse node information is absent.

As part of this hackathon, you will use product metadata to classify products into categories. You will have access to product title, description, bullet points etc. and labels for ~40K products to train and test your submissions.
